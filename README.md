* Missing Values
   *  [Concepts of MCAR, MAR and MNAR](https://stefvanbuuren.name/fimd/sec-MCAR.html) - stefvanbuuren.name
   * In statistics and data science, replacing missing values with the mean value of the remaining data in the variable is a form of **imputation**, which is a general term for techniques used to estimate and replace missing data with substituted values. 
   * **Capping** in the context of data analysis is a method used to limit or "cap" extreme values in a dataset in order to reduce the impact of outliers. This method is also known as "winsorizing" or "truncation".

* [Security Breach Notification Laws](https://www.ncsl.org/technology-and-communication/security-breach-notification-laws) - ncsl.org

#### Entity relationship requirements
*  The [cardinality](https://www.thedataschool.co.uk/eamonn-woodham/high-cardinality-vs-low-cardinality/) of a column refers to the number of distinct values that the column can take on. A column with high cardinality has a large number of distinct values, while a column with low cardinality has a small number of distinct values.
*  Data classification
   *  Business Classification: Public, Internal, Sensitive, Highly Sensitive
   *  Military Classifiation: Unclassified, Classified, Secret, Top Secret

### Given a scenario, apply data quality control concepts
#### Automated Validation
* The **number of data points** is simply a count of all the measurements or observations within your data set. This is an important concept in statistical analysis, where the number of data points can affect everything from the reliability of your results to the types of analysis you can perform.

### Explain master data management (MDM) concepts
#### Processes
* A **data dictionary** is a centralized repository of information about data, such as its meaning, relationships to other data, origin, usage, and format. It serves as a catalog or a guide to understanding what data is in a system, how it is organized, and how it is used.
* **"Standardization of data field names"** is a data management practice that involves creating a consistent format for naming data fields across a database or a collection of datasets. It ensures that the same type of information is always referred to by the same name and format. For example, one dataset might use "DOB" as a field name to indicate a person's date of birth, while another dataset might use "BirthDate". Standardizing these field names across all datasets might involve deciding to always use "DateOfBirth" for this information. This makes it immediately clear what information is contained in that field, regardless of which dataset you're looking at.
